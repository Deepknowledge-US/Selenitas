# Selenitas
Selenitas is a multiAgent system framework built on top of [Lua](http://www.lua.org) as programming language, and [Löve](https://love2d.org/) for 2D representation. It is heavily inspired in [NetLogo](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/), at least in this first development, but with a more scientific and academic goal in the long term.

Now it is in a very first stage of development, but soon we hope to offer in this page something that you can test with several examples and documentation to build your own models.
