# Selenitas
Selenitas is a multiAgent system framework built on top of [Lua](http://www.lua.org) as programming language, and [LÃ¶ve](https://love2d.org/) for 2D representation. It is heavily inspired in [NetLogo](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/), at least in this first development, but with a more scientific and academic goal in the long term.
